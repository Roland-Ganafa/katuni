# GitHub Push Instructions

Follow these steps to push your katuni project to GitHub:

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and log in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository `katuni`
4. Choose Public or Private as per your preference
5. **Important**: Do NOT initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push Your Code

After creating the repository, replace the placeholder commands below with your actual GitHub username:

```bash
# Remove any existing remote
git remote remove origin

# Add the correct remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/katuni.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

## Step 3: Verify

After pushing, refresh your GitHub repository page to confirm that all files have been uploaded successfully.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter authentication issues:
1. Make sure you're logged into GitHub
2. Consider using a Personal Access Token instead of your password
3. Check that your Git credentials are properly configured

If you get "Permission denied" errors:
1. Verify that the repository name is exactly `katuni`
2. Confirm that you have write access to the repository
3. Check that you're using the correct username in the URL
