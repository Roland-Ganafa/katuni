## Key Configuration Details

### Environment Variables
Vercel will need the following environment variable:
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Your Google Gemini API key

### Build Settings (Auto-detected by Vercel)
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist`
- **Install Command**: `npm install`

## Deployment Steps

1. Commit and push all changes to your GitHub repository
2. Go to Vercel dashboard and import your repository

1. Consider implementing a backend proxy to protect your API key
2. Monitor your API usage and set up billing alerts
3. Rotate your API keys regularly
